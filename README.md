# GPT Automate API

In early 2023, I was working on a final project for my programming course. As a result, I created vscode-gpt-automate, which ended up being one of the first agentic coding tools ever made.

It was severely limited for the time. 8k context window + expensive models + broke student didn't make for a fantastic start, but it was one of the most fascinating projects I've ever built.

The requests were routed to this API which I have kept private for quite a while, but will be publicizing it today (3/11/25) to reflect back on. 
It's funny to see how terminology changed for certain things, "RFC" not requiring a handshake, commands standardized as Tool Calling in the MCP, or the fact that responses could contain regular text alongside commands

Enjoy the code! Note: **there is an API key inside of the prompt.js edit history -- this key does not work, and the org id is outdated.**
